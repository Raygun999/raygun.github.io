About me
======
I am currently a master's student at the University of Zurich, with a major in Informatics. My journey from business to computer science has equipped me with a broader perspective on technology's technical and business aspects.

With experience in diverse cultural and professional environments, Iâ€™ve developed a strong ability to adapt to different environments. My experience has ranged from designing user-centric applications to improving system efficiencies, always with a focus on creating meaningful solutions that address real-world needs.

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and enhance user experiences. My international experience has given me a global perspective, which I always bring to every project and opportunity. I am particularly interested in opportunities that allow me to work on innovative projects and collaborate with diverse teams.
